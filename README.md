# Arcade Game
## About
### Description
This is a simple **arcade game clone** to run on the web. The player must get across to the water without hitting any bugs along the way. Gems can also be collected for extra points.

### Origins
The game was created as part of the _Udacity_ Front-End Nanodegree course. It was created from the following [GitHub repository](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game) which contains the resources and game engine.

### Process
Some the **challenges** faced while developing the application are as follows:
- Using object oriented programming
- Prototypal classes and pseudoclassical subclasses
- Using the `this` keyword extensively
- Applying **collision detection** to sprites
- Thinking creatively to expand the game

## Installation
To install the app simply clone/download this repository and open index.html in your browser.

## Instructions
### Goal
The aim of the game is to reach the water while avoiding all the bugs along the way. Each time the player manages this their score is incremented, while touching any of the bugs will reset the score to 0. In addition, collecting any of the gems will further increase the players score.

### Controls
- _Move up_ = 'up arrow'
- _Move down_ = 'down arrow'
- _Move left_ = 'left arrow'
- _Move right_ = 'right arrow'
- _Change character_ = 'spacebar'
